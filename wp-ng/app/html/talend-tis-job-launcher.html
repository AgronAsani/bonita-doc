<h1>1.8.17 Talend TIS Job launcher connector</h1>
<p>The Talend TIS Job launcher connector enables you to launch a Talend Integration Suite (TIS) job.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Talend Integration Suite (TIS) to provide an integrated view of data from many data sources and a process updates one of those data sources,
you could trigger a job to update the view.</p>
<p>The job is defined in TIS and specified by the id that was set when the job is created.</p>
<p>You cannot pass data through the connector to the job, and the connector does not return any output.</p>
<p>To configure the Talend TIS Job launcher connector, follow the steps in the wizard. To configure the job use the information below:</p>

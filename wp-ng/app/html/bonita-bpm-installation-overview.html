<h1>2 Bonita BPM installation overview</h1>
<p>Bonita BPM exists in four <a href="http://www.bonitasoft.com/node/14673/products-v2#versions">editions</a>: Performance, Efficiency, Teamwork, and Community.</p>
<p>For the Bonita BPM Subscription Pack editions, Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork, you need to <a href="/licenses.md">install a license</a>. The license depends on the edition, the deployment environment, and the number of cores.</p>
<p>For the Bonita BPM Community edition, no license is needed.</p>
<h2>Bonita BPM Studio and Bonita BPM Platform</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/bonita-bpm-overview.md#bonitastudio">Bonita BPM Studio</a> is the tool for business analysts and developers to design processes.</li>
<li><a href="/bonita-bpm-overview.md#bonitaplatform">Bonita BPM Platform</a> is the server part of the solution.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonita BPM Studio</h3>
<p>Bonita BPM Studio has an embedded test platform that includes an Apache Tomcat application server, an h2 database and the Bonita web application (that itself includes Bonita BPM Engine).</p>
<p>To install Bonita BPM Studio you can either use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/bonita-bpm-studio-installation.md">installer</a> for your operating system (Windows, Mac OS, Linux).
Used to install Bonita BPM Studio (using a wizard) on your computer. No configuration necessary.</li>
<li>The <a href="/bonita-bpm-studio-installation.md#all_os">OS independant</a> package. Used to manually set up Bonita BPM Studio.
The package contains the individual launchers in one .zip file, and creates the same installation environment as the installers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonita BPM Platform</h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have **already installed ** a Community edition or a Subscription edition,
and want to migrate to the latest version version, follow the instructions to <a href="/migrate-earlier-version-bonita-bpm.md">migrate your platform</a>.</p>
<p>You have two options to install a Bonita BPM Platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have not already installed a Java application server, you can get one of our bundles, <a href="/jboss-bundle.md">JBoss + Bonita BPM</a> or <a href="/tomcat-bundle.md">Tomcat + Bonita BPM</a>,
ready to be used out of the box.</li>
<li>If you have an existing application server installation (for example JBoss or Tomcat),
you can use the <a href="/deploy-bundle.md">Deploy bundle.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For all options, you will need to <a href="/database-configuration-2%0D%0A">configure</a> Bonita BPM Engine to work with the database of your choice (e.g. PostgreSQL or Oracle).</p>

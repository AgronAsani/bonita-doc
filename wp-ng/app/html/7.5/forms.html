	<h1>3.5.3 Forms</h1>
    <p>This page explains how to add a form resource to the Portal and make it available to users. Form resources are intended for use in applications.</p>

<dl><dt><a href="#form_definition">Form definition</a></dt>
</dl><p>Pages are <a href="/resource-management.html">exported. imported, modified, and deleted</a> as resources in Bonita BPM Portal. </p>


<h2 id="form_definition">Form definition</h2>

<p>A form is a <a href="/pages.html">page</a> that belongs to a process. It could be a process instantiation form, a human task form, or an overview form. There are some extra things to consider when you are creating a form compared with an ordinary page, concerning how data is passed between the process instance and the form.</p>

<p>A <a href="/contracts-and-contexts.html#context">context</a> is the set of data provided by the process instance or task instance to the form. 
There is no context for a process instantiation form.</p>

<p>A <a href="/contracts-and-contexts.html">contract</a> is the definition of that data that the form returns to the process instance. There is no contract for an overview form.</p>

<p>Three auto-generated forms are provided by default, for process instantiation, for human task execution, and for the case overview. </p>
<p>The process instantiation and step execution auto-generated forms are based on the relevant contract and they are a useful tool for testing and debugging your application. </p>

<p></p>The overview consists of three main sections:
<ul><li>List of business data: it shows the content of the business variables used by the case.</li>
<li>List of documents: it shows the content of each document used by the case.</li>
<li>Timeline: it shows in chronological order information about all the actions that have been performed in the selected case.</li>
</ul><p>You can see how to manage the link between process and and form in the documenation about  <a href="/live-update.html#forms">live update</a>   </p>

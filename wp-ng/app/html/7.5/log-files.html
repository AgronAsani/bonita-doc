	<h1>1.13.4 Log files</h1>
    <p>During development, the Studio log file and UI designer log file contain messages about development activities, including any errors. 
When you run a process for testing, messages are written to the Engine log file.</p>

<p>From the Bonita BPM Studio Help menu you can access the Studio log file 
and the Engine log file. The UI designer log file is available in var_bh_code_replace<code>/tomcat/logs/ui-designer.log</code>, but it is not accessible from the Studio Help menu. 
</p>

<p>See the <a href="/logging.html">Logging overview</a> for details of how logging is implemented in Bonita BPM and how to add logging to Groovy scripts or Java code that you add to a process</p>

<h2>Studio log file</h2>

<p>To access the Studio log file,  choose <strong>Bonita BPM Studio log</strong> from the <strong>Help</strong> menu.</p>

<p>For Bonita BPM Studio, you can set the level of logging. Edit the <code>config.ini</code> in the Studio root/configuration/ directory and set the value of 
<span class="tt">eclipse.log.level</span> to <span class="tt">ERROR</span>, <span class="tt">WARNING</span>, <span class="tt">INFO</span>, or <span class="tt">ALL</span>.</p>

<table border="2" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%"><tr><td><span class="tt">ERROR</span></td>
<td>Only error messages are logged</td>
</tr><tr><td><span class="tt">WARNING</span></td>
<td>Only error and warning messages are logged</td>
</tr><tr><td><span class="tt">INFO</span></td>
<td>Error, warning, and Info message are logged (this is the default)</td>
</tr><tr><td><span class="tt">ALL</span></td>
<td>All messages are logged, including debug information</td>
</tr></table><h2>Engine log file</h2>

<p>When you run a process locally from Bonita BPM Studio for testing, you can access the Engine log file by choosing <strong>Bonita BPM Engine log</strong> from the <strong>Help</strong> menu. 
The logging level for Engine when it is started from Studio is always <code>INFO</code>. </p>

<p>On a deployed system, you can configure the log level and you can access the log files directly, in <span class="tt"><em>BONITA_HOME</em>/tomcat/logs</span>. 
Each file name includes the date when the file was created. There are several log files:</p>

<ul><li><span class="tt"><em>bonita.date</em>.log</span> is the Bonita BPM Engine log file.</li>
<li><span class="tt"><em>catalina.date</em>.log</span> is the log file for the Tomcat application server used by Bonita BPM Studio.</li>
<li><span class="tt"><em>host-manager.date</em>.log</span>, <span class="tt"><em>localhost.date</em>.log</span>, and <span class="tt"><em>manager.date</em>.log</span> are internal Tomcat log files. </li>
</ul></div>

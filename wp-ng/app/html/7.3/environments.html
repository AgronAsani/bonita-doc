	<h1>1.12.2 Environments</h1>
    <a id="top"></a>
<p>An environment is a set 
of configuration definitions for a project. You can configure a process for 
several environments. In this way, one process can run in several environments 
without any modification, because the information that is specific to an 
environment is set at configuration. In the Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions, Bonita BPM Studio proposes three 
environments, Local, &#xA0;Production, and Qualification. You can also define 
custom environments.</p>
<p>You can configure, run, and debug a 
process in a specific environment.</p>
<p>The default environment is the one 
most recently selected in the Configure, Run, or Debug menus in the Cool 
bar.</p>

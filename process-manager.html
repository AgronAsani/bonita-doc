<h2 id="assign">Assign a Process manager to a process</h2>

<p>There are two stages to assigning a Process manager to a process: assign the Process manager profile to an entity, then map the process to the entity. 
You can assign the PM profile and map a process to a user, groups, role, or membership entity.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="monitoring">Monitor the processes I manage</h2>

<p>A Process manager can monitor the activity of the processes they can manage in <strong>Monitoring</strong>.</p>


<p></p>

<h2 id="list_apps">List the processes I manage</h2>

<p>A Process manager can see a list of the processes they can manage in <strong>Processes</strong>.</p>


<p></p>

<h2 id="see_cases">See a list of cases for a process</h2>
<p>A Process manager can see a list of cases for the processes they can manage in <strong>Cases</strong>.</p>


<p></p>

<h2 id="see_tasks">See a list of tasks for cases of a process</h2>

<p>A Process manager can see the tasks for cases of a process they can manage in <strong>Tasks</strong>.</p>

<p></p>


<h2 id="assignATask">Assign a task</h2>
<p>A task can be assigned and reassigned if necessary to another user.</p>
<ol><li>Go to <strong>Tasks</strong></li>
    <li>Click on a <strong>task in the list of tasks</strong></li>
    <li>Click <em><strong>Assign</strong></em></li>
</ol><h2 id="unassignATask">Unassign a task</h2>
<ol><li>Go to <strong>Tasks</strong></li>
    <li>Click on a <strong>task in the list of tasks</strong></li>
    <li>Click <em><strong>Unassign</strong></em></li>
</ol><h2 id="skip">How to skip a failed task</h2>

<p>If a failed task does not impact subsequent task in a process, the Process manager can skip it. This means that the task does not have to be done successfully for the following tasks to become available.</p>
<ol><li>Go to <strong>Tasks</strong>.</li>
    <li>Go to <strong>Failed</strong>.</li>
    <li>Click on a Task.</li>
    <li>Click <em><strong>More</strong></em>.</li>
    <li>In <strong>Technical details</strong>, the reason for the failure is displayed</li>
    <li>Click <em><strong>Skip</strong></em>.</li>
</ol><p>The task is moved from Failed to Done.</p>

<h2 id="start_case_for">Start a case for another user</h2>

<p>A Process manager can start a case for another user. The user must have the right to start a case of the process.</p>

<p>To start a case for another user:</p>

<ol><li>Log in as a Process manager for the process.</li>
    <li>Go to <strong>Processes</strong>.</li>
    <li>Select the process and click <strong><em>Start for</em></strong>.</li>
    <li>In the popup, specify the user for whom you are starting the case. Only valid users for the case are displayed.</li>
    <li>Click <strong><em>Start</em></strong>.</li>
</ol><p>The case is started as though the specified user had started it. 
For example, if a Process manager starts a case for user A and a subsequent task is to be done by the manager of the user, it is assigned to user A's manager, not to the manager of the Process manager.</p>



<h2 id="do_task_for">Do a task for another user</h2>

<p>A Process manager can do a task for another user. The user must have the right to do the task. This is useful for unblocking a case if the assigned user cannot do a task.</p>

<p> To performs a task for another user:</p>

<ol><li>Log in as a Process manager for the process.</li>
    <li>Go to <strong>Tasks</strong> and view the list of pending Human tasks.</li>
    <li>Select the relevant task in the list and click <strong>Do for</strong>.</li>
    <li>In the popup, specify the user for whom you are doing the task. Only valid users for the case are displayed. If the task is already assigned, the assigned user is specified automatically.</li>
    <li>Click <strong><em>Do it</em></strong>.</li>
</ol><p>The task is done as though the specified user has done it.</p>

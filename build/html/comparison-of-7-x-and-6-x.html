<h1>Comparison of 7.x and 6.x</h1>
<h2>Packaging comparison</h2>
<p>In Bonita BPM 6.x, two versions are available for download:</p>
<ol>
<li>the Bonita BPM Subscription Pack edition version for the Performance, Efficiency, and Teamwork editions</li>
<li>and the Bonita BPM Community edition version for the Community edition
For each version, there are several packaging options. Each edition has a specific {{ var_bonita_home }} that must be downloaded and installed | There is pnow a single {{ var_bonita_home }}, simplifying download options and installation. The edition is set in a properties file. There are no other differences to packaging.

<tr>
<td>Contract</td>
<td>Not in 6.x</td>
<td>A contract defines a clear separation between the process and the forms, making it possible to update the process user interface on the live system. See <a href="contracts-and-contexts.md">Contracts</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Live update</td>
<td>Not in 6.x</td>
<td>A live update is a change that is applied to a process or application on the live system, without needing to pause the platform or take a process out of service. See <a href="live-update.md">Live update</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Form mapping</td>
<td>Not in 6.x</td>
<td>A form is mapped to process instantiation, to case overview, or to a task. Any form that respects the relevant contract can be used. This separation between the process and the forms makes it possible to to the live update feature</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Business data</td>
<td>A process or application can use business data managed by the Bonita BPM Platform. (Subscription editions only)</td>
<td>Now available in all editions. See <a href="define-and-deploy-the-bdm.md">BDM</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Actor mapping</td>
<td>Each actor in a process can be mapped to a Group, Role, Membership or User within an organization. The mapping can be refined using an actor filter.</td>
<td>No change. See <a href="actors.md">Actor mapping</a> and <a href="actor-filtering.md">Actor filtering</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Environments</td>
<td>An Environment is a set of configuration information for a particular process. It contains the following information:  actor mapping, actor filters, parameters, connector implementations, dependencies for processes and applications. By having these Environments set up in the Studio, the developer can export processes that are ready to be run for a specific target platform. At any point in time, there is only one active Environment in Studio</td>
<td>No change. See <a href="environments.md">Environments</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Parameters</td>
<td>A Parameter is configuration information that can be attached to a process. Parameters are configured for an Environment. Parameter values can be updated at runtime.</td>
<td>Now available in all editions. See <a href="parameters.md">Parameters</a> and <a href="environments.md">Environments</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Workspace API</td>
<td>The Workspace API is provided to generate <code>.bar</code> files from the command line, ready for production. .BAR files are for deployment only and cannot be read by the Studio. .BOS files are for Studio interchange only and cannot be deployed to production. Each file format is optimal in term of content and is optimized for the target use case</td>
<td>No change. The Workspace API can export pages that are mapped to process instantiation, process overview, or to tasks. It cannot export application pages that are not elements of a process. See <a href="automating-process-builds.md">Automating process builds</a></td>

<tr>
<td>UI designer</td>
<td>Not in 6.x</td>
<td>A new development environment for creating sophisticated, data-driven pages and forms for process-based applications. The UI designer is accessed through the Studio. See <a href="live-update.md">live update</a>. The 6.x <a href="6-x-legacy-forms.md">form tooling</a> is still supported, so that you can continue to run 6.x processes and to ease migration</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Process migration</td>
<td>A process exported from Bonita Open Solution 5.9 or 5.10 must be modified to run in Bonita BPM. When you import a process from 5.9 or 5.10 into Bonita BPM Studio, you see a report that guides you through the changes that are necessary. See <a href="migrate-a-process-from-bonita-open-solution-5-x.md">Migrate a process from Bonita Open Solution 5.9 or 5.10</a></td>
<td>A process created in Bonita BPM 6.x will run in 7.x without any modification. However, to take advantage of the new features in Bonita BPM 7.x, you need to add contracts and migrate the forms. See <a href="contracts-and-contexts.md">Contracts</a> and <a href="migrate-a-form-from-6-x.md">Migrate a form from 6.x</a></td>

<tr>
<td>REST API extensions</td>

<tr>
<td>Expression Editor</td>
<td>This expression editor enables a developer to define a constant, an expression, a comparison or a Groovy script. Very often, there is no need to resort to a Groovy script, a constant, a comparison or an expression being enough. A number of predefined expressions are provided.  Convenience Groovy functions are provided to help write scripts more quickly. These functions provide simple access to frequently used information, such as information on the current user and the process initiator. It is now very easy to retrieve the manager or the email of the current user or the process initiator</td>
<td>No changes to the expression editor. It is not available from the UI designer. See <a href="expressions-and-scripts.md">Using expressions and scripts</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Validation</td>
<td>The validation view shows all validation errors in the same location in the Studio. This enables developers to quickly locate validation errors wherever they appear</td>

<tr>
<td>Iteration</td>
<td>Iteration can be by loop or by multi-instantiation. Multi-instantiation no longer requires a specific Bonita connector nor implementation of a specific java class.

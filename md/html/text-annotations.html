<h1 id="text-annotations">1.5.9 Text annotations</h1>
<p>A text annotation is a comment in a diagram.</p>
<p>You can attach a comment to a specific element in the diagram, by choosing the text annotation icon above an element and placing it next to the element. You can also attach comments to a pool, independent of any specific element.</p>
<p>To do this, select the text annotation icon from the <strong>BPMN elements</strong> menu to the left of the screen, and drop it on the diagram inside a pool or lane outline.</p>
<p>Text annotations are unformatted text. To enter text, select the annotation and go to the Details panel, General tab, <strong>General pane</strong>. You can also enter text directly into the annotation when you first create it.</p>
<p>Text annotations are useful to exchange information with other business analysts viewing or developing the process. They are also a useful way of storing information that might be required for process maintenance (similarly to comments in HTML source files).</p>

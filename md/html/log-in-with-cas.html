<h1 id="log-in-with-cas">4.5.7 Log in with CAS</h1>
<p>Depending on your underlying authentication service, you may need to provide other information with the API in order to log in. A login method with a map enables you to provide the set of credentials that the authentication service requires. The following example can be used if you are <a href="/single-sign-cas.md">using Bonita BPM with CAS</a>:</p>
<p><code>final LoginAPI loginAPI = TenantAPIAccessor.getLoginAPI(); final Map credentials = new HashMap(); credentials.put(AuthenticationConstants.CAS_TICKET, ticket); APISession session = loginAPI.login(credentials); ProcessAPI processAPI = TenantAPIAccessor.getProcessAPI(session);</code></p>

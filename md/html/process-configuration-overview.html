<h1 id="process-configuration-overview">1.12 Process configuration overview</h1>
<p>There are two reasons for configuring a process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuring a process for testing</li>
<li>Configuring a process before deployment</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you can run a process from Bonita BPM Studio for testing, you must configure it. The configuration is partly set implicitly by the Deployment and Web preferences set as <a href="/bonita-bpm-studio-preferences.md">Bonita BPM Studio preferences</a> and is partly set explicitly by <a href="/configuring-process-bonita-bpm-studio.md">configuring the process using the configuration wizard</a>.</p>
<p>Before you export a process for deployment, you need to set the initial configuration <a href="/configuring-process-bonita-bpm-studio.md">using the configuration wizard</a>. This configuration is exported with the process if you check the Configuration option in the export dialog when you <a href="/import-and-export-process.md#build_for_deployment">build a .bar archive</a>. If you are using the Performance edition, you can <a href="/processes.md">update the configuration after deployment</a>. For other editions, you can modify the actor mapping only.</p>

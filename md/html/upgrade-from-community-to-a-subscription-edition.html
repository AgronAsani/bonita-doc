<h1 id="upgrade-from-community-to-subscription-edition">2.8 Upgrade from Community to Subscription edition</h1>
<p>Upgrading means moving from a Bonita BPM Community edition environment to any Bonita BPM Subscription edition environment.</p>
<p><strong>Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An upgrade can only be performed on a single Bonita BPM versions. You cannot migrate to a new version at the same time as you update edition.</li>
<li>After it is applied, an upgrade cannot be undone.</li>
</ul>
<p>An upgrade is performed in two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#studio_upgrade">Bonita BPM Studio upgrade</a></li>
<li><a href="#platform_upgrade">Bonita BPM platform upgrade</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bonita-bpm-studio-upgrade">Bonita BPM Studio upgrade</h2>
<p>To upgrade a Community edition Bonita BPM Studio and its resources (such as process diagrams, data models), follow these steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="/bonita-bpm-studio-installation.md">Install a Bonita BPM Studio</a> Subscription edition.</li>
<li>Export your resources from the Bonita BPM Studio Community edition to <code>.bos</code> files. We recommend that you keep these resource files as a backup.</li>
<li>Import your resource files into the Bonita BPM Studio in Subscription edition.</li>
</ol>
<p>The upgrade is performed automatically and silently when importing resources into Bonita BPM Studio Subscription edition.</p>
<p>Remember that an upgrade is a non-reversible operation: after your resources are imported in the Subscription edition, you will not be able to export from the Subscription edition Studio and then import them back into the Community edition.</p>
<h2 id="bonita-bpm-platform-upgrade">Bonita BPM platform upgrade</h2>
<p>Upgrading a Bonita BPM platform allows you to keep the platform data (process definitions, cases, BDM...) while benefiting from the Subscription edition features.</p>
<p>The upgrade procedure is quite simple and only requires a limited service downtime (less than an hour for basic configurations).</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> A Bonita BPM platform upgrade can only be performed on the same database type.</p>
<p>To upgrade a Bonita BPM platform from Community edition to a Subscription edition, follow these steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="/back-bonita-bpm-platform.md">Backup your Bonita BPM platform and databases</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure that the platform is shut down.</li>
<li><a href="/product-bos-sp/basic-bonita-bpm-platform-installation">Install a new Bonita BPM platform</a> Subscription edition with an H2 database. (The database is only used temporarily).</li>
<li>Start the Bonita BPM Subscription platform for the first time (this will initialize the platform data).</li>
<li>Log in to the Bonita BPM Portal as the technical user (default login and password: install) to make sure that your installation is functional.</li>
<li>Shut down the server.</li>
<li><p>Reset the Bonita BPM Portal menus by deleting this file: <code>/engine-server/work/tenants/1/profiles.md5</code></p></li>
<li>Overwrite the <code>/engine-server/work/tenants/1/processes</code> folder of your Subscription edition installation with your backup files for the this folder from the Community edition. This will transfer your process definitions.</li>
<li><p>If the Community edition platform was running on a H2 database, use the files from your Community edition back to overwrite the following files of your Subscription edition installation:<br />
<code>/engine-server/work/platform/bonita_journal.db.h2.db</code><br />
<code>/engine-server/work/platform/business_data.db.h2.db</code></p></li>
<li>If the Community edition platform was not running on a H2 database:</li>
<li><p>From your Subscription edition installation, delete these files:<br />
<code>/engine-server/work/platform/bonita_journal.db.h2.db</code><br />
<code>/engine-server/work/platform/business_data.db.h2.db</code></p></li>
<li><p>Configure your Subscription edition platform to use your Community edition database.</p></li>
<li>Start the Subscription edition platform.</li>
<li>Log in to the Bonita BPM Portal with your administration or personal account (it should have been imported during the upgrade).</li>
<li>Validate that the dialog displayed from the top right &quot;Settings / About&quot; menu indicates the correct Subscription edition.</li>
<li><p>Validate that your platform data is properly upgraded. This is the end of the upgrade procedure.</p></li>
</ol>

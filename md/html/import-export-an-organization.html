<p><strong>Caution:</strong> This will import a file containing your whole organization data. This organization data will be merged with existing data. In case of conflict, the priority is given to the data in the imported file. Take care not to overwrite information that has been updated in Bonita BPM Portal.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In 6.3 there was a change to the structure of the .xml file. This means that you cannot import into Bonita BPM Portal 6.3.0 or later an organization .xml file that was created in 6.2.x or earlier. You will need to first import the organization file into Bonita BPM Studio and re-export it, so it is compatible.</p>
<p>To import an organization in .xml format, that has already been exported from Bonita BPM Studio, containing your whole organization data.</p>
<p>Be careful, your organization will be merged with existing data.</p>

<h1 id="data-handling-overview">1.6 Data handling overview</h1>
<p>In a BPM-based application, use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/busines-data-model">Business variables</a> for information that</li>
<li>is mostly used by Bonita BPM</li>
<li>has meaning after a process instance is archived</li>
<li>is used at several places in the process</li>
<li>is read by a process to orientate its flow</li>
<li>is shared across several process instances</li>
<li><p>is displayed in an application page</p></li>
<li>Task-level <a href="/specify-data-process-definition">process variables</a> for</li>
<li>intermediate computation results (for example a connector result to be used as input of the next connector)</li>
<li><p>information that is private to the process, not used elsewhere in the application</p></li>
<li>Pool-level <a href="/specify-data-process-definition">process variables</a> for information that</li>
<li>can be read by the process to orientate its flow</li>
<li>can be used at several places in the process</li>
<li><p>is private to the process, not used elsewhere in the application</p></li>
<li>External databases, with <a href="/connectivity-overview.md">connectors</a> and <a href="/complex-data-types.md">custom data types</a>, for information that</li>
<li><p>is used by multiple applications besides Bonita BPM</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Key benefits of using business data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control of indexing strategy</li>
<li>Definition of custom queries to efficiently read the data</li>
<li>Full control of lifecycle of the data through the set of processes that handle it (add, update and delete)</li>
<li>Improved performance compared with process variables or external databases</li>
<li>Easier application maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>An application page accesses business data using the <a href="/bdm-api.md">bdm REST API</a>. A page also contains page <a href="/variables">variables</a>, which have no meaning outside the page.</p>
<p>The data that is passed from a form to a process is defined using a <a href="/contracts-and-contexts.md">contract</a>. Define a contract for process instantiation and for each human task. These contracts are part of the process definition. A form has access to business data and documents using the <a href="/contracts-and-contexts.md">context</a> and the <a href="/product-bos-sp/web-rest-api.md">REST API</a>. A form also contains form <a href="/variables">variables</a>, which have no meaning outside the form.</p>

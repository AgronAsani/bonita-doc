					<li>Create a folder by path</li>
					<li>Upload a file to a destination folder</li>
				</ul><p>Notes for using these connectors:</p>

<ul><li><div class="alert alert-warning"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign"></span><strong> Warning:</strong> 
There is a conflict between libraries provided with the Alfresco connector and libraries provided by other connectors or the platform itself if you use a data of type Object.

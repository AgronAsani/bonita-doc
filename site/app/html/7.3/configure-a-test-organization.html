<h1>Configure a test organization</h1>
<p>This page describes how to set up a test organization in Bonita BPM Studio, for process testing.</p>
<h2>The ACME example organization</h2>
<p>Bonita BPM Studio includes a sample
organization, called ACME. This organization contains a small number of users,
who belong to different groups with realistic roles.</p>
<p>You can use this example organization to explore how to
manage an organization in Bonita BPM Studio, for example by adding a user, or
changing the role of a user. You can also use this sample organization to test a process
that you develop.</p>
<h2>Managing organizations</h2>
<p>Within Bonita BPM Studio, more than one organization can be defined.
This is useful if you are developing a process that will be deployed in several
different organizations. It is also useful for testing, because you can create
a reduced version of your organization that has the same structure but fewer
users, saving time in managing your test environment.</p>
<p>To an organization, you create the
organization, create the group hierarchy, specify roles, and then add users and
their memberships.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Bonita BPM Studio.</li>
<li>Go to the Organization menu and select <strong>Manage....</strong></li>
<li>Add a new organization:</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Add</em></strong>. A line will be added to the table of organizations, with a placeholder name such as Organization1.</li>
<li>Change the placeholder name to the name of your organization, and add a description.</li>
<li>Add groups to your organization:</li>
<li>Select the name of your organization and click <strong><em>Next</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Add group</em></strong> to add a group. You can specify the following:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>* the group Name, which is used internally by the Bonita BPM software
* the Display name, which is the group name displayed in lists and wizards
* the Path, which shows the hierarchical relationship between groups
* a Description of the group
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Click <strong><em>Add group</em></strong> to add the next group, and
continue until you have added all the groups required. You can also add a subgroup,
by selecting a group and clicking <strong><em>Add subgroup</em></strong></li>
<li>When you have added all the groups you need,
click <strong><em>Next</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Specify roles in your organization:</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Add</em></strong>, and add a role called member. This will be the default role for users within a group.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Add</em></strong> and add the other roles you
require. Typically, most organizations have a Manager role so the group manager
can be easily identified, but the specific roles you require will depend on
your processes. Remember that it is not necessary to copy all the role
information from your business organization into your Bonita BPM organization,
but instead you should just create the roles that are useful in processes.</li>
<li>When you have specified all the roles you
require, click <strong><em>Next</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Add users to your organization.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Add</em></strong>. A default username is added to the list of users.</li>
<li>You can change the username, but the value must be in a format the Bonita BPM software can use: only unaccented alphanumeric characters are permitted plus a period (.). One option is to use the personal part of the user's email address, that is, the part before the @ sign.</li>
<li>Specify a password for the user. The password characters are not displayed, so keep note of the password you choose.</li>
<li>Specify the manager of the user.</li>
<li>In the <strong>General</strong> tab, specify the Title, First name, Last name, and Job title of the user.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Membership</strong> tab, specify the groups that the user belongs to, and what role they have in each group.</li>
<li>You can also specify <strong>Personal contact</strong> and <strong>Professional contact</strong> information for the user.</li>
<li>Add all the users in your organization. When you have finished, click <strong><em>Finish</em></strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Exporting and importing an organization</h2>
<p>You can export an organization definition from Bonita BPM Studio. The exported file is in XML, so can be modified. You can import an
organization definition in this XML format that was exported from another
Bonita BPM Studio running the same version of Bonita BPM, or that was constructed
by some other method but has the same format. You can also import the organization file
into Bonita BPM Portal, ready for production.</p>
<h2>Modifying an organization</h2>
<p>To modify an organization, choose <strong>Manage...</strong> from the Organization menu and use the same dialogs that
you used to create the organization.</p>
<p>To modify an item in an organization, select it in the item
list and modify the information on the right-hand side of the list.</p>
<p>To delete an item, select and it click <strong><em>Remove</em></strong>.</p>
<h2>Publishing an organization to Bonita BPM Portal</h2>
<p>Publishing an organization means uploading the organization data to Bonita BPM Portal so that you can test your process.
To upload organization data into Bonita BPM Portal permanently, so a process can run when Bonita BPM Studio is not running, you need to export
the organization from Bonita BPM Studio and import it into Bonita BPM Portal.</p>
<p>To upload the organization data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Publish... from the Organization menu.</li>
<li>Click the organization to be uploaded, and
then click Next.</li>
<li>Specify the username and password of the user that will be
used to log in to Bonita BPM Portal when a process is started from
Bonita BPM Studio. This user must be in the organization you have
selected.</li>
<li>Click Publish.</li>
</ol>
<p>After it has been uploaded, you can <a href="organization-in-bonita-bpm-portal-overview.md">modify the organization in Bonita BPM Portal</a>.</p>

<h1>1 Bonita BPM overview</h1>
<p>Bonita BPM 7 is a powerful BPM-based application platform for building highly engaging, personalized, process-based business applications that adapt to your business changes in real time.</p>
<p>Bonita BPM has two parts: the development environment, Bonita BPM Studio, and the runtime environment, Bonita BPM Platform.</p>
<h2>Bonita BPM Studio</h2>
<p>Bonita BPM Studio is a graphical environment for creating processes and application pages. It contains
two major design tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>the whiteboard, for drawing a process flow diagram and
defining the detail of steps, transitions, decision points and other process
elements</li>
<li>the UI designer, which is used to create application pages and process forms</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonita BPM Studio is the development tool for the Business Analyst and Application Developer.</p>
<p>You can <a href="bonita-bpm-installation-overview.md">install Bonita BPM Studio</a> on your computer, then create and test
processes. Bonita BPM Studio contains a <a href="#bonitaplatform">Bonita BPM Platform</a> (Tomcat, Bonita BPM Portal, Bonita BPM Engine, and an h2 database), suitable for testing a process that is in development.</p>
<p>In Bonita BPM Studio, once the process is ready, you can then <a href="build-a-process-for-deployment.md">build</a> it and deploy it on your Bonita BPM production platform.</p>
<p>To build your completed process into a process-based application, you use the UI designer to create the application pages, then use the Bonita BPM Portal application builder to construct the application.</p>
<h2>Bonita BPM Platform</h2>
<p>Bonita BPM Engine is the execution engine of Bonita BPM.</p>
<p><a href="bonita-bpm-portal-interface-overview.md">Bonita BPM Portal</a> is the part of Bonita BPM that is visible to process users,
who use it to view tasks and take actions. Bonita BPM Portal is also the tool used by the process administrator
to <a href="processes.md">install, deploy and manage processes</a> and to <a href="applications.md">build applications</a>.</p>
<p>To install Bonita BPM Engine and Bonita BPM Portal, <a href="bonita-bpm-installation-overview.md">install Bonita BPM Platform</a>.</p>
<h2>Editions</h2>
<p>Bonita BPM is provided in four different editions: Community, Teamwork, Efficiency, Performance.</p>

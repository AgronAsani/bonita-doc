<h1>3 Bonita BPM Portal interface overview</h1>
<h3>The User interface</h3>
<p>The User interface is divided into 3 main columns: left, middle and right.</p>
<p>The left column is for filters, the middle column for bulk actions and right column for actions and more details about the selected item.</p>
<h3>Default profiles</h3>
<p>There are three default profiles available in the Portal: <strong>User</strong>, <strong>Administrator</strong>, and (in the Efficiency and Performance editions) <strong>Process manager</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Administrator profile</strong> is responsible for the administration of the Portal and particularly for the management of the Processes, the organization, the reports, the custom profiles and the Look &amp; Feel.
(See example of the Administrator interface).</p>
<p>The <strong>Process manager profile</strong> shares responsibility for management of Processes that are assigned.</p>
<p>The <strong>User profile</strong> is responsible for performing the tasks for which they are a candidate and also for starting new cases of the Processes to which they have access.(See example of the User interface).</p>
<h3>Access to menus</h3>
<p>Each profile has access to a diferent set of drop down menus, containing filters and action buttons corresponding to their user rights.</p>
<p>Note: A user with an admin profile has to be created by the technical user in order to manage the organization and other users. See <a href="/first-steps-after-setup.md">First steps after setup/Create an Administrator user</a>.</p>

	<h1>3.3 Log in and log out</h1>
    <p>This page tells you how to log in as a user with a profile and rights attached to that profile.</p>
<p>You can also switch between users with different rights,(e.g. user profile and admin profile), to access different management menus.</p>
<p>Note: to avoid login problems, make sure you empty your browser cache <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser&apos;s-Cache">Empty your cache for different browsers</a>
</p><h2>How to log in as a user</h2>
<p>If for example, you receive an email with a link to start a case or a task in the Bonita BPM Portal, you will need to log in.</p><ul><li>Enter the login page url, <code>http://</code><em><code>hostname:port</code></em><code>/bonita/</code>, to get to the login page as a user. The default port number is 8080.</li>
<li>In the user field, enter the <strong>login</strong>, and  the <strong>password</strong> for this user.</li>
<li>Click on the <em><strong>Login button</strong></em>.</li>
</ul><h2>How to log out and log back in as another user</h2>
<ul><li>Go to the <em><strong>Tool bar</strong></em> at the top of the interface.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>username</strong> menu (your username in the top right of the screen) and choose <em><strong>Logout</strong></em>.</li>
<li>This will log you out and then display the <strong>login form</strong>.</li>
<li>In the user field, enter the <strong>name</strong> of a different user, enter the <strong>password</strong> for this user.</li>
<li>Click on the <em><strong>Login button</strong></em>.</li>
</ul><p>Logging out will send the user back to the login page.</p>

<p>Note: in a system that uses CAS to provide single sign-on, the administrator can remove the logout option. In this case, to log out of the portal you must log out of the CAS system or close your browser.</p>

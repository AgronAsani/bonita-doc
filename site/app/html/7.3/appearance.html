<h1>1.7.2.9 Appearance</h1>
<p>Page and form appearance is based on the Bootstrap v3.3.2 CSS framework.
To define the appearance of a page or form you can use an application <a href="/theme-resources">theme resource</a>,
apply a Boostrap theme,
or manual add a custom CSS class that you implement.</p>
<h2>Apply an application resource theme</h2>
<p>By default, pages designed with UI designer are deployed in an <a href="/applications.md">application</a>
and use the theme chosen for the application.</p>
<h2>Apply a Boostrap CSS theme</h2>
<p>Many Bootstrap CSS themes are available
(for example at <a href="https://bootswatch.com/">https://bootswatch.com/</a>).</p>
<p>To apply a Bootstrap theme, download it and add it to your page or form as a <a href="/assets.md">CSS asset</a>.
To see the result, preview your page.
Applying a Bootstrap theme as a CSS asset will override the application theme.</p>
<h2>Customize appearance</h2>
<p>The appearance of a page or form widget can be modified with a CSS stylesheet.</p>
<p>The UI designer pages use the Bootstrap CSS, so the markup provided for widgets uses Bootstrap CSS classes.
You can add classes by using the <em>CSS classes</em> property field available
for each widget in the whiteboard.</p>
<p>Then, to customize the widget appearance, include a <a href="/assets.md">CSS asset</a> in your page or form.
In this CSS file you can either override the Bootstrap CSS classes or implement the
classes you specify in the <em>CSS classes</em> property field.</p>

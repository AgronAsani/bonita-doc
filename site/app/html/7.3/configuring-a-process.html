<p>To configure a process, open the process diagram, select the pool, and click <strong><em>Configure</em></strong> in the Cool bar.</p>
<p>If you are using a Performance, Efficiency, or Teamwork edition of Bonita BPM, you can configure a process for an <a href="environments.md">environment</a>:
with the process diagram open and the pool selected, choose an environment from
the Configuration menu in the Cool bar.</p>
<p>The configuration wizard indicates the items that need to be configured, with a reminder in the wizard title bar for each category. Check the <em>Display advanced configuration</em> box to
see all the items that need to be configured. Follow the instructions in the configuration wizard to complete the configuration.</p>
<p>The following items can be configured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actor mapping</li>
<li>Connectors</li>
<li>Parameters</li>
<li>Actor filters</li>
<li>Process dependencies</li>
